## Features

* [x] Text-to-image

Upcoming

* [ ] Image-to-image
* [ ] Inpainting + Masking
* [ ] CLIP guidance
* [ ] Multi-prompting

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* Stability AI requires you to create your own API key to make calls to the API. You can create one [here](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication).

* Create a `.env` file and set your Stability AI API key

### Usage

The example provided is using the SDK directly in a Flutter app. In most cases, you're going to use the SDK in the backend using tools like [Dart Frog](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog). This is to secure the API key and to have more control of the incoming requests, e.g. controlling rate limits or blocking sensitive content.

```dart
// 1. Setup the API client
final client = StabilityApiClient.init("<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>");

// 2. Create a generation request
final request = RequestBuilder("an oil painting of a dog in the canvas, wearing knight armor, realistic painting by Leonardo da Vinci")
    .setHeight(512)
    .setWidth(512)
    .setEngineType(EngineType.inpainting_v2_0)
    .setSampleCount(1)
    .build();

// 3. Subscribe to the response
client.generate(request).listen((answer) {
    image = answer.artifacts?.first.getImage();
});

```
